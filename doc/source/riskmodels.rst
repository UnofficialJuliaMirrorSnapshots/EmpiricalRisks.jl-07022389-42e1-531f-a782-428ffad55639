Risk Models
=============

The prediction model together with a (compatible) loss function constitutes a *risk model*, which can be expressed as :math:`loss(f(x; \theta), y)`.

In this package, we use a type ``SupervisedRiskModel`` to capture this:

.. code-block:: julia

    abstract RiskModel

    immutable SupervisedRiskModel{PM<:PredictionModel,L<:Loss} <: RiskModel
        predmodel::PM
        loss::L
    end

We also provide a function to construct a risk model:

.. function:: riskmodel(pm, loss)

    Construct a risk model, given the predictio model ``pm`` and a loss function ``loss``.

    Here, ``pm`` and ``loss`` need to be *compatible*, which means that the output of the prediction and the first argument of the loss function should have the same number of dimensions.

    Actually, the definition of ``riskmodel`` explicitly enforces this consistency:

    .. code-block:: julia

        riskmodel{N,M}(pm::PredictionModel{N,M}, loss::Loss{M}) =
            SupervisedRiskModel{typeof(pm), typeof(loss)}(pm,loss)


.. note::

    We may provide other risk model in addition to supervised risk model in future. Currently, the *supervised risk models*, which evaluate the risk by comparing the predictions and the desired responses, are what we focus on.


Common Methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a set of inputs and the corresponding outputs are given, the *risk model* can be considered as a function of the parameter :math:`\theta`.

The package provides methods for computing the *total risk* and the derivative of the total risk *w.r.t.* the parameter.

.. function:: value(rmodel, theta, x, y)

    Compute the total risk *w.r.t.* the risk model `rmodel`, given

    - the prediction parameter ``theta``;
    - the inputs ``x``; and
    - the desired responses ``y``.

    Here, ``x`` and ``y`` can be a single sample or matrices comprised of a set of samples.

    **Example:**

    .. code-block:: julia

        # constructs a risk model, with a linear prediction
        # and a squared loss.
        #
        #   risk := (theta'x - y)^2 / 2
        #
        rmodel = riskmodel(LinearPred(5), SqrLoss())

        theta = randn(5)  # parameter
        x = randn(5)      # a single input
        y = randn()       # a single output

        value(rmodel, theta, x, y)  # evaluate risk on a single sample (x, y)

        X = randn(5, 8)   # a matrix of 8 inputs
        Y = randn(8)      # corresponding outputs

        value(rmodel, theta, X, Y)  # evaluate the total risk on (X, Y)


.. function:: value_and_addgrad!(rmodel, beta, g, alpha, theta, x, y)

    Compute the total risk on ``x`` and ``y``, and its gradient *w.r.t.* the parameter ``theta``, and add it to ``g`` in the following manner:

    .. math::

        g \leftarrow \beta g + \alpha \nabla_\theta \mathrm{Risk}(x, y; \theta)

    Here, ``x`` and ``y`` can be a single sample or a set of multiple samples. The function returns both the evaluated value and ``g`` as a 2-tuple.

    .. note::

        When ``beta`` is zero, the computed gradient (or its scaled version) will be written to ``g`` without using the original data in ``g`` (in this case, ``g`` need not be initialized).


.. function:: value_and_grad(rmodel, theta, x, y)

    Compute and return the gradient of the total risk on ``x`` and ``y``, *w.r.t.* the parameter ``g``.

    This is just a thin wrapper of ``value_and_addgrad!``.


Note that the ``addgrad!`` method is provided for risk model with certain combinations of prediction models and loss functions. Below is a list of combinations that we currently support:

- ``LinearPred`` + ``UnivariateLoss``
- ``AffinePred`` + ``UnivariateLoss``
- ``MvLinearPred`` + ``MultivariateLoss``
- ``MvAffinePred`` + ``MultivariateLoss``

If you have a new prediction model that is not defined by the package, you can write your own ``addgrad!`` method, based on the description above.
